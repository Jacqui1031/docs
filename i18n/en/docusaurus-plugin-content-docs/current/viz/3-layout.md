# Layout

"Layout" is the way to arrange elements in a visual interface. It can be shared with project members, helping to present device data in an intuitive visual manner, enabling users to efficiently view and analyze various types of multimodal data.

## Create a layout

Click on **Layout** in the upper - right corner of the visual interface to enter the layout management page. You can create a layout in the following ways: **Create blank layout**, **Copy from other project**, or **Import from file**.

### Copy from other project

By copying the layout of an existing project, you can quickly obtain a basic layout framework that meets some of your requirements. Then, you can modify and adjust it based on this framework, which greatly saves the time of layout design and improves work efficiency.

## Layout use cases

### Personal layout

Only you can access your personal layout - no one else can view, load, or edit it.

Changes to your personal layout will be synced to all your computers and can be copied as a project layout for sharing.

### Project layout

Project layouts provide a way for teams to organize a set of standardized layouts for common data visualization within the project.

When a project is made public, the project layouts will also be made public so that visitors can use suitable layouts when browsing the visualized data.

## Manage layouts

You can directly browse the layout folders on the left side. They are divided into: All, Personal, and Project.

:::

### Rename

Modify the name of the layout for better identification and classification.

### Copy

Copy the layout as a personal/current project layout.

### Move to folder

Move the layout to other folders within the current category (personal/project).

### Export

Export the layout as a json file for sharing or use in other environments.

### Delete

Delete layouts that are no longer needed to keep the layout list clean and efficient.

:::info
ðŸ¤– If you delete a project layout, users who can access this project will no longer be able to use this layout.
